## Development
You can test the app locally by running the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

>[!Note]
> We decided to use Lit using the scaffolding provided by Vite. Although you can use the page by running the development server, you will not be able to use it by building the project and serving the static files. We still havenÂ´t figured out why this is happening, but we will continue investigating about it.
